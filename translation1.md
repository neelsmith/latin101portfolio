Chaos prīmus deōrum erat. Fīliae eius, Nox et Terra, māter omnium hominum, erant. Haec māter Mortis et Lētī erat. Illīus fīliī horribilia mōnstra erant: Typhon, Python, et Cyclōpēs. Typhon et Python dracōnēs ingentēs erant et Cyclōpēs fabrī brūtī. Sed frāter eōrum Ūranus, prīmus ipse rēx deōrum. Hic fortis et magnus erat, sed sapiēns.
